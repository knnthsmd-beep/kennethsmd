        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken or pork broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cornstarch slurry (cornstarch mixed with water)</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for sautéing</li>
        <li>Optional toppings: crushed chicharon, green onions, calamansi</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol type = "I">
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Sauté garlic and onion until fragrant and translucent, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced pork (or your choice of meat) and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. If using shrimp, add them now and cook for 2 minutes until pink.</li>
        <li>Pour in the broth and bring to a boil. Add soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 10 minutes to develop flavors.</li>
        <li>Add carrots, cabbage, and kikiam/fish balls. Cook for another 5 minutes until vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li>Stir in the miki noodles and cook for 3-5 minutes until softened. If the noodles are dry, blanch them separately first.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the cornstarch slurry while stirring continuously to thicken the broth. Simmer until it reaches a thick, gravy-like consistency, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and slowly drizzle in the beaten eggs while stirring to create egg ribbons.</li>
        <li>Serve hot in bowls, topped with crushed chicharon, chopped green onions, and a squeeze of calamansi for extra flavor.</li>
    </ol>
